## Predicting-Chronic-Hunger-

#### Executive Summary
　This document presents an analysis of data concerning the annual prevalence of undernourishment at the country level. The analysis is
based on 1401 observations, each containing indicators of a country'condition potentially related to its prevalence of undernourishment.
<p>　The dataset is provided by After exploring the data by calculating summary and descriptive statistics, and by creating visualizations of the data, several potential relationships between automobile characteristics and price were identified. After exploring the data, a predictive model to classify automobiles into two pricing categories was created, and finally a regression model to predict an automobile price from its features was created.<p>
