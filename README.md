## Predicting-Chronic-Hunger-
 Building a regression model predicting Chronic Hunger using data from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations


#### Executive Summary
<p>　This document presents an analysis of data concerning the annual prevalence of undernourishment at the country level. The analysis is
based on 1401 observations, each containing indicators of a country's conditions potentially related to its prevalence of undernourishment.<p>
<p>　The dataset is provided by After exploring the data by calculating summary and descriptive statistics, and by creating visualizations of the data, several potential relationships between a country's socioeconomic indicators and its prevalence of undernourishment were identified. After exploring the data, a regression model to predict a country's undernourishment from its features was created.<p>
<p>　After performing the analysis, the author presents the following conclusions:<p>
While many factors can help indicate the prevalence of undernourishment, significant features found in this analysis were:
* fertility_rate
* avg_supply_of_protein_of_animal_origin
* access_to_improved_water_sources
* obesity_prevalence
* open_defecation
* Urban_population_share
* prevalence_of_undernourishment
